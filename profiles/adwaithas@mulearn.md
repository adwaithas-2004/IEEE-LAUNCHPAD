## Portfolio Highlights
         |

#### Leadership and Influence:

- As an electronics engineering student passionate about IoT and embedded systems, I’ve taken the lead in various academic and personal tech projects. At college, I’ve initiated and led group projects focused on real-time problem solving, such as designing a smart temperature monitoring system using the 8051 microcontroller. I often take the initiative in organizing study groups and mentoring classmates on circuit design, microcontroller programming, and project prototyping. My ability to break down complex concepts and inspire curiosity among peers has allowed me to become a natural influencer within my domain.
#### Networking:

- I actively network with peers, mentors, and professionals through technical meetups, student chapters like IEDC, and online platforms such as GitHub and LinkedIn. I plan to expand this network by collaborating on open-source IoT projects and participating in hackathons and startup events. By connecting like-minded innovators and encouraging a collaborative approach, I aim to build a community-driven culture that supports aspiring tech creators in Kerala.
#### Career Plan:

- In the short term, I plan to develop open-source tools focused on core electronics and IoT for smart city and environmental monitoring applications. I aim to collaborate with Kerala-based startups to pilot these projects. In the long term, I hope to launch a tech venture focused on affordable and scalable IoT hardware solutions, contributing to Kerala’s startup ecosystem through mentorship, innovation, and job creation.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

- Kerala has great potential to become a hub for deep-tech and hardware startups. With strong academic institutions, rising startup culture, and initiatives like KSUM (Kerala Startup Mission), we can excel by building more hardware incubators, promoting local manufacturing, and increasing access to prototyping labs. Encouraging open-source development and public-private partnerships can further elevate Kerala as a leader in the tech startup landscape.



#### History of Open Source Contributions:

- I have contributed to small but impactful open-source projects, particularly around microcontroller interfacing and IoT modules. I’m currently working on a reusable library for interfacing DHT11, LM35, and ADC modules with the 8051 microcontroller, which I plan to release for public use and documentation.

#### History of Community Engagement:

-  I frequently help others on discussions, especially in areas like assembly programming in microcontrollers, circuit simulation (Proteus), and basic electronics. I also engage in Discord communities centered around electronics and IoT.
#### Highly Visible Technical Content:

- I’m in plan of launching a technical blog on microcontroller projects, with Proteus simulation files and source code, DIY electronics and debugging real-world circuit issues.

#### Highly Used Software Tools:

- One of my recent tools—a Proteus simulation pack with pre-configured microcontroller modules—is being used by a small group of college students to aid their learning and project development. I plan to publish and promote this tool publicly after further refinement.
